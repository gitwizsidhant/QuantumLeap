# Calculator Application using Tkinter

This is a simple calculator application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Instructions

1. **User Interface**: Upon running the script, a window will open displaying the calculator interface.

2. **Display Screen**: The large display screen at the top shows the current input and the result of calculations.

3. **Buttons**:
   - Digits (0-9): Clicking on these buttons appends the corresponding digit to the current input.
   - Operations (+, -, *, /, %): These buttons perform arithmetic operations on the current input.
   - Equal to (=): Calculates the result of the expression.
   - Clear (C): Clears the current input.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. The calculator window will appear.
3. Click on the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations.
4. Press the "=" button to get the result.

## Example Usage

1. To perform addition:
   - Input: `5 + 3`
   - Press "="
   - Result: `8`

2. To perform subtraction:
   - Input: `10 - 7`
   - Press "="
   - Result: `3`

3. To perform multiplication:
   - Input: `4 * 6`
   - Press "="
   - Result: `24`

4. To perform division:
   - Input: `20 / 5`
   - Press "="
   - Result: `4.0`

5. To clear the input:
   - Press "C"

## Note

- The calculator only handles basic arithmetic operations. It does not support more advanced mathematical functions.

- Division by zero will result in an error.

- Ensure that the input is in a valid format before pressing "=".

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library
