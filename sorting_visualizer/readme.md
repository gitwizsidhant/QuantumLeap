# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

## Overview

This Python program provides a visual representation of several sorting algorithms using the Tkinter library for GUI. The implemented algorithms include:

- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitwizsidhant/sorting-algorithms-visualizer.git

## Usage

1. Launch the program using the provided installation instructions.
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the drop-down menu.
3. Select the sorting speed (Fast, Medium, Slow).
4. Click on the "Create Array" button to generate a random array of values.
5. Click on the "Sort" button to visualize the selected sorting algorithm.

## Features
